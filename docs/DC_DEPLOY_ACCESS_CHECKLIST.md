## 1️⃣ SSH Access to SaathiFEStg Server

### Required Information

**Request from infrastructure team:**

```yaml
Server Hostname/IP: "<provide IP or hostname>"
SSH Port: "22" (default)
SSH Username: "<e.g., deploy, ubuntu, saathi>"
Authentication: "SSH key or password"
```

### Action Items

**For Infrastructure Team:**

- [ ] Create user accounts for Akarsha, Sunitha (optional), Tanuj (optional)
- [ ] Collect SSH public keys from team members
- [ ] Add public keys to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on SaathiFEStg
- [ ] Verify team members can SSH successfully
- [ ] Ensure users have correct permissions for `/var/www/saathi` (or app directory)
- [ ] Add users to appropriate groups (`www-data`, `deploy`, etc.)

**For Team Members:**

- [ ] Generate SSH key pair if don't have one:
  ```bash
  ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com" -f ~/.ssh/saathi_staging_rsa
  ```
- [ ] Send public key to infrastructure team:
  ```bash
  cat ~/.ssh/saathi_staging_rsa.pub
  ```
- [ ] Test SSH connection once access granted:
  ```bash
  ssh -i ~/.ssh/saathi_staging_rsa <username>@<host>
  ```

### Server Details Template

**Fill this out and share with team by Feb 5:**

```bash
# SaathiFEStg Server Access
export STAGING_HOST="<IP or hostname>"
export STAGING_USER="<username>"
export STAGING_SSH_KEY="~/.ssh/saathi_staging_rsa"

# Test connection
ssh -i $STAGING_SSH_KEY $STAGING_USER@$STAGING_HOST

# App location on server
export APP_DIR="/var/www/saathi"  # Confirm this path
```

```

### Action Items

**For Infrastructure Team:**

- [ ] Confirm PostgreSQL is accessible from outside (or requires SSH tunnel)
- [ ] Configure `pg_hba.conf` to allow connections from team IPs
  ```
  host    naarisamata_staging    naarisamata_user    <Akarsha_IP>/32    md5
  ```
- [ ] Or document that SSH tunnel is required
- [ ] Provide database credentials securely (encrypted email, password manager)
- [ ] Verify Akarsha can connect successfully

**For Akarsha:**

- [ ] Receive database credentials
- [ ] Test direct connection:
  ```bash
  psql "postgresql://naarisamata_user:<PASSWORD>@<DB_HOST>:5432/naarisamata_staging"
  ```
- [ ] If direct connection fails, set up SSH tunnel:
  ```bash
  ssh -L 5433:<DB_IP>:5432 <USER>@<STAGING_HOST>
  # Then connect to localhost:5433
  psql "postgresql://naarisamata_user:<PASSWORD>@localhost:5433/naarisamata_staging"
  ```
- [ ] Verify can run migrations:
  ```bash
  npx prisma migrate deploy

export DB_PASSWORD="<password>"

# Full connection string
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://$DB_USER:$DB_PASSWORD@$DB_HOST:$DB_PORT/$DB_NAME"

# Test connection
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "SELECT version();"

# If direct connection not working, use SSH tunnel:
# ssh -L 5433:$DB_HOST:$DB_PORT <USER>@<STAGING_HOST>
# Then: export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://$DB_USER:$DB_PASSWORD@localhost:5433/$DB_NAME"

## 🚨 What to Do if Access Issues Arise

**Day of Integration (Feb 6):**

1. **Don't wait** - escalate immediately if can't connect
2. **Akarsha blocked?** - Contact Tanuj + infrastructure team
3. **Sunitha blocked?** - Akarsha can deploy for her
4. **Database unreachable?** - Use SSH tunnel as workaround
5. **SSH not working?** - Use password auth temporarily

**Emergency Contacts:**

```
Tanuj: <email/phone>
Infrastructure Team: <email/phone>
```

**Fallback Plan:**

If staging infrastructure not ready by Feb 6:
- Continue development locally
- Akarsha deploys database to Heroku/Railway/Supabase (temporary)
- Sunitha tests with Akarsha's local backend
- Deploy to staging on Feb 7 instead
- Adjust demo schedule if needed
